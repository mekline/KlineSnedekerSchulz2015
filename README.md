Stimuli used in forced-choice experiments testing children's preferences for novel transitive verbs.  

KSS_Spatiotemporal1 contains stimuli used in Experiment 1, which contrasts matched versions of events that either do or do not have a spatiotemporal 'break' interrupting the causal event.  Events 1-2 were used for warmup (no transitives/intransitives used), and events 3-6 for the language forced-choice task.  

KSS_Spatiotemporal2 contains stimuli used in Experiment 2, which contrasts 'action at a distance' causal events with versions that have the same subparts (agent's action, interesting patient outcome) reversed in onset time.
